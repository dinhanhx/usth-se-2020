# Customers:
Designing a new system or software must root back to the need of customers - users of our system or people that are purchasing this system for the users.
It is fundamental that the software provide some value to the customers, which is why “customers” are put on top of any other element.
## Oportunity:
An opportunity is a chance to do something to bring some benefit to customers, for example: alleviate an existing problem or lessen the current amount of work
## Stakeholders:
Stakeholders are individuals, organizations or groups that are concerned about the development and application of the system.
# Solution:
In prior to building of the system, the solution or the outcome of this endeavor must be outlined. This performs as a guideline to design essential components of the systems and their utility.
## Requirements:
Requirements represent an overview of what the software system is expected to provide, which means they only demonstrate the function but do not specify the methods behind that.

Changing requirements are one of the biggest challenges software teams encounter.
## Sorftware Systems:
It is evident that the software system itself is the primary outcome. A qualified sofware must meet these criterias:

Functionality – Must serve some function

Quality – Reliability, Performance, Rich user experience, etc.

Extensibility – From version to version and platform to platform
# Endeavor
Endeavor is a an attempt to achieve creation of a unique product, service or specific outcome
## Team

## Work
- Teamwork makes dreamwork
- Work should be put under constraint of Time and Effort.
  -  Time is set limit by deadline.
  -  Effort is set limit by human strength and knowledge.

## Way of working
- All members of one class should unite to make a way of working like a communist party. 
	- The available means to produce as well as human force should be implemented to get the work done.
	- No individuals are allowed to use must be used by all.
	- The whole members should improve the tools if the right time has come.
- Making the process of producing agreement that everyone follows is a big problem.
